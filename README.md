## Chatbot fullstack application

### Overview
This repository contains a fullstack application for a chatbot that uses FastAPI, React, MySQL and the pretrained DialgoGPT model from AutoModelForCasuallLM. 
The programming languages used are Python and JavaScript.


### Purpose
The primary objective of this application is to exercise the fullstack creation using FastAPI, React and MySQL for a simple fun chatbot.

### How It Works
1. **FastAPI**:  Backend using ORM structure with models, schemas and database configuration.
   
2. **React**: Frontend using React framework for a simple webb GUI integration with the backend.
   
3. **MySQL**: Using MySQL database to store users and chatbot messages/responses.

### Applications
The usage of this app is for user registration and login as well as the core functionality for basic questions or messages since the chat model used isnt very good. 

### Improvements
Further improvements could be to make the application deployable using docker and run it on microsoft azure or heruko, tests suuch as unit tests could also be added to ensure functionality works as intended.
